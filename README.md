Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-software engineering is defined as sytemacally applied engineering principles, methods and tools devolop and maintain high quality software systems
- software engineering is very important because it enables software application and it also powers systems of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-IoT devices: Hardware that have a wireless network connection and are integrated into equipment or other devices, so they can receive and share data
-Mobile apps: Are computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch.
-OS (Windows):Allows users to view and store files, run the software, play games, watch videos, and provides a way to connect to the internet. 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Phase 1: Planning, involves defining the software’s purpose and scope, much like pinpointing our destination and plotting the best route.
Phase 2: Requirements Analysis seeks to identify and record the precise requirements of the final users. In this phase, the team is looking to answer, “What are the expectations of our users from our software?”
Phase 3: Designis All about building the framework. The development team is responsible for software engineering and outlines the software’s functionality and aesthetic. 
Phase 4: Coding is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code, their aims is to develop software that is functional, efficient, and user-friendly.
Phase 5: Testing Involves quality inspection on a production line. It is when vulnerabilities are uncovered
Phase 6: Deployment After crafting a product with precision, it’s time to present it to the users by pushing to the production environment.
Phase 7: Maintenance is characterized by constant assistance and improvement, which guarantees the software’s best possible functioning and longevity and ensures it meets customer expectations.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall approach is named this way beacause it reflects how the process moves along from one phase to the next when previous phase is finished.
-Example: We can go up again but not as easy as going down, it will be like climbing up the waterfall so we try to avoid.
-Agile methodologies which are more responsive to changing requirements, are used when the requirements of a system are not understood at the beginning of the development project.
-Example: Agile are flexible like swinging chair and is easy to move up and down as long as you have an experience team. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software Developer: software developer roles and responsibilities is to meet with business leaders to learn about a company’s needs. Those needs might require software management, software design, or building software. A software developer will code the software using the pertinent programming language or supervise a team that does so
-Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures that the software passes all checks before its release to the public. They oversee every phase of design, development, testing and delivery to verify if the product meets the quality standards and requirements, and they work with a team and report to a manager.
-Project Manager: Roles and Responsibilities involves a proper way of planning and leading software projects. It is a part of project management in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored, and controlled. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-integrated development environment (IDE) helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.
- Example:NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Visual Studio.
-Version control systems streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features.
-Example: Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-The rapid advancement of technology
-Time limitation: software engineers should use relevent apps that could save their time
-Limited infrastructure/ resources
-Conflicting requirements: software engineers should pay attention to stakeholders

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-unit:a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually scrutinized for proper operation. Software developers and sometimes QA staff complete unit tests during the development process.
-integration:  a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity. However, these modules may be coded by different programmers.
-system: also referred to as system-level testing or system integration testing, is the process in which a quality assurance (QA) team evaluates how the various components of an application interact together in the full, integrated system or application.
-acceptance:  a quality assurance (QA) process that determines to what degree an application meets end users' approval. Depending on the organization, acceptance testing might take the form of beta testing, application testing, field testing or end-user testing.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.
- it is important because it helps AI to make acurate and specific outputs

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Tel me something about yourself
